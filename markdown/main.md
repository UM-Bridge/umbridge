# UM-Bridge

![UM-bridge_map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UM-Bridge/benchmarks/main/docs/source/images/UM-bridge_map.png "UQ-Model-UM")

**UM-Bridge** is a universal interface that makes any numerical model accessible from any programming language or higher-level software, with a main focus on uncertainty quantification (UQ). It accelerates development from method research to applications and from prototype to supercomputer, enabling you to:

* **seamlessly link** numerical models to UQ across languages and frameworks,
* **break down complexity** of advanced applications into manageable components,
* **share** your containerized models with collaborators,
* **benchmark** your algorithms on a community-driven benchmark library, and
* **scale** your applications from laptop to **supercomputer or cloud** with minimal effort.

UM-Bridge only assumes that a model returns an output vector for a given input, and possibly offers derivatives and configuration options. That makes UM-Bridge suitable for fields like **UQ, optimization or machine learning**.

![UQ-Model-UM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UM-Bridge/benchmarks/main/docs/source/images/UQ-Model-UM.png "UQ-Model-UM")

Try out this Python example! It passes an input to a simple 1D test model running on a remote server and prints the model's output.

```
import umbridge

model = umbridge.HTTPModel("http://testmodel.linusseelinger.de", "forward")
print(model([[100.0]]))
```

Interested? Continue with [quickstart](https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/quickstart.html) or [tutorial](https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/tutorial.html) for a guided tour. See [clients](https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/umbridge/clients.html) for how to interact with a model from any supported language or UQ package, and [models](https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/umbridge/models.html) for how to add UM-Bridge support to your own model code.

In addition, UM-Bridge comes with a community-driven **library of UQ benchmark** problems, which you find listed on the left.

We'd like to hear about your application, so [join our slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/um-bridge/shared_invite/zt-1da1ebkly-8s0YQdZUIYkJ1vws6edsAQ)!

We build on UM-Bridge in order to couple the flow simulation to applications from fields like
geomechanics and geochemistry, which proved reasonably straightforward due
to the elegance of the UM-Bridge implementation. Next, we plan to use UM-Bridge with Pflotran-OGS in order to investigate the long-term effects of
geological uncertainty on CO2 storage.*

> *The UQ software that I develop is in Matlab, which is great for prototyping
and distribution but
a bit troublesome when it comes to working with engineers since most of
them develop their simulators in other languages.
UM-Bridge takes that problem away so I was more than happy to contribute to
the project!*
