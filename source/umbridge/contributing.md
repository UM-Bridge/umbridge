# Contributing

The goal of UM-Bridge is to connect software packages, research projects and communities. Contributions are therefore more than welcome!

We are happy to help with any questions regarding contributions or usage of UM-Bridge.

This also holds for the closely related benchmark library, whose sources can be found in the [benchmarks repository](https://github.com/UM-Bridge/benchmarks).

Possible contributions might include:
* Fixes and extensions
* Support for new languages or specific software packages
* New benchmarks and models for the UM-Bridge benchmark library

## Documentaiton

The [documentation](https://um-bridge-benchmarks.readthedocs.io/en/docs/) covers both UM-Bridge itself as well as the benchmark library.

It is built from markdown files in both repositories.

## Contributions

Contributions may be submitted via [pull requests on GitHub](https://github.com/UM-Bridge/umbridge/pulls).

Testing (and deployment, when appropriate) is conducted via GitHub workflows.

## Bug reports and feature requests

Please send bug reports and feature requests via [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/UM-Bridge/umbridge/issues).

If possible, provide instructions for how to reproduce an issue. For issues that occur with specific models, it is helpful to refer to a container from the benchmark library that exposes the issue.
