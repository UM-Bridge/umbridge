# Composite material with random wrinkle

## Overview
This model implements the 3D anisotropic linear elasticity equations for a composite part with randomised wrinkle. The maximum deflection of the part is estimated by embedding a wrinkle into a high fidelity FE simulation using the high performance toolbox dune-composites.

## Description
In the simulation the composite strength of a corner part with a wrinkle is modeled and the maximum deflection is returned. The stacking sequence of the composite corner part can be set using the "stack" configuration parameter, by default a 12 layer setup is used. A simplified model for a 3D bending test was used. The curved composite parts were modelled with shortened limbs of length 10 mm. A unit moment was applied to the end of one limb using a multi-point constraint, with homogeneous Dirichlet conditions applied at the end of the opposite limb. This gives the same stress field towards the apex of the curved section as a full 3D bending test. The analysis assumes standard anisotropic 3D linear elasticity and further details on the numerical model and discretisation can be found in [1].

The wrinkle defect is defined by a deformation field $W:\Omega \rightarrow \mathbb R^3$ mapping a composite component from a pristine state to the defected state. 

The wrinkles are defined by the wrinkle functions

$$
  W(x,\xi) =  g_1(x_1)g_3(x_3)\sum_{i=1}^{N_w} a_i f_i(x_1,\lambda),
$$

where $g_i(x_i)$ are decay functions , $f_i(x_1,\lambda)$ are the first $N_w$ Karhunen-Lo\'{e}ve (KL) modes parameterized by the length scale $\lambda$ and $a_i$ the amplitudes. The amplitude modes and the length scale can be taken as random variables, so that the stochastic vector is defined by $\boldsymbol \xi = [a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{N_w},\lambda]^T$.
The wrinkles are prismatic in $x_2$, e.g. the wrinkle function  is assumed to have no $x_2$ dependency. For more details on the wrinkle representation see [2].
